Recognition Derivatives Exchange (RDX)

A technical specification for a tokenless, privacy-preserving, smart-contract capable system that implements the Free-Association mathematics (Mutual-Recognition, General/Specific Shares, Mutual-Desire and Allocation) and enables a new class of non-monetary "recognition derivatives" (options/rights to capacities).

This document describes architecture, data model, APIs, cryptographic primitives, execution and settlement, governance, dispute resolution, privacy, scaling, and example flows for Individuals, Organizations, and Sovereigns.

High-level goals

1. Respect Non-transferability: Recognition and derived shares are non-transferable by default.

2. Mutual Consent & Mutual Desire: Both sides must consent for allocations to execute; system enforces minima rules.

3. Privacy & Verifiability: Participants’ private valuations (recognition percentages, desires) remain confidential but outcomes are provable.

4. Tokenless Smart Contracts: Use programmable logic (on-chain/off-chain) but avoid tokenizing recognition as tradeable assets.

5. Interoperability: Integrate with existing identity, data-oracle, and clearing infrastructures (optional fiat or crypto rails for hybrid cases).

6. Composability: Support slot-to-slot composition and higher-order supply chains.

7. Legal/Compliance Aware: Provide hooks for KYC/AML where capacity types or participants require it (e.g., organizational or cross-border flows).

Core Concepts & Data Model

Entities

Participant (P): Individual, Organization, or Sovereign. Has an immutable identifier (DID). Owns 100% Total-Recognition.

Recognition Matrix (R): For each ordered pair (A,B): R[A][B] ∈ [0,100] representing A's recognition share of B's contribution towards A's self-actualization (percentage of A's Total-Recognition).

MutualRecognition (MR): MR(A,B) = min(R[A][B], R[B][A]).

Capacity (C): Declared by a provider Prov(C) with structured metadata: type, quantity, slot(s), filters, divisibility, max_per_recipient, constraints, oracle_source.

Filter: Boolean predicate per participant used to compute Specific-Share (e.g. skills, location, certification).

Desire (D): D[Recipient][Prov][Capacity] ∈ ℕ (units desired) or continuous fraction.

Mutual-Desire (MD): MD = min(Provider_Desire, Recipient_Desire) per the spec.

Identifiers

All participants use Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). Public keys sign commitments.

Capacities and slots use UUIDv4.

Storage model

On-chain (optional, light): anchors of state (commitments, hashes of recognition snapshots, capacity declarations, commitments to desires) — small, auditable footprint.

Off-chain: encrypted graphs (recognition values, desires) stored in participants' local stores and optional distributed data stores (IPFS/Arweave) encrypted under threshold keys. Computation-heavy tasks executed off-chain in MPC/TEE or verified via zk-proofs.

---

Cryptography & Privacy Model

Goals

Keep recognition values and desires private unless mutually exposed for settlement.

Allow verifiable proofs that allocation rules were followed.

Primitives

1. DIDs & Verifiable Credentials: Identity and attributes.

2. Commitment Schemes: Pedersen commitments for recognition & desires: commit(x; r).

3. Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) OR Trusted Execution Environments (TEE): For computing MR matrices, normalization, and allocations without revealing raw inputs.

4. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK-SNARK/PLONK): To prove correctness of allocation computations given committed inputs.

5. Threshold Encryption & Proxy Re-Encryption: For sharing decrypted results only with mutually interested parties (or arbitrator if dispute).

6. Replay-proof Signed Messages: All declarations signed and timestamped.

Privacy Workflows

Commit Phase: Participants commit hashes/commitments of recognition vectors and desires on-chain or in append-only logs. These commitments timestamp state without revealing values.

Compute Phase: An MPC/Tee computes MR, normalized shares, and tentative allocations. It produces zk-proofs matching commitments.

Reveal Phase: Only data required for settlement is revealed to involved counterparties, and receipts (signed confirmations) are anchored on-chain.

Core Algorithms (pseudocode)

Mutual Recognition and General-Share

# Inputs: recognition commitments R[A][*] (encrypted/committed), R[\*][A]

# Compute MR[A][B] = min(R[A][B], R[B][A]) for all pairs where both committed

# For provider P and recipient U:

GeneralShare(U, P) = MR(P, U) / SUM\_{x in RecipientsOfP} MR(P, x)

Specific-Share & Allocation

SpecificShare(U, P, Capacity) = GeneralShare(U,P) \* Filter(U,Capacity)
NormalizeSpecificShares across filtered recipients to sum to 1.

MutualDesire(ProvCapacity, Recipient) = min(ProviderDeclaredToRecipient, RecipientRequestedFromProvider)
NormalizedMRShare = MR(Prov, Recipient) / SUM\_{r in MutuallyDesiringRecipients} MR(Prov, r)
RawAllocation = Capacity.quantity \* NormalizedMRShare
FinalAllocation = min(RawAllocation, MutualDesire)
Redistribute unused capacity among unsatisfied mutually-desiring recipients iteratively

Zero-waste Redistribution (iterative)

Keep a worklist of unsatisfied recipients; while leftover > epsilon: recompute normalized MR among unsatisfied recipients and allocate proportionally; stop when no more progress.

---

Execution Model: Off-chain Compute with On-chain Anchors

1. Participants register their DID and optionally KYC credentials (if required by capacity type) via an Identity Registry.

2. Participants declare capacities (metadata + commitment) and broadcast encrypted declarations to a discovery layer.

3. Recipients express desires (encrypted commitments) and commit them on the ledger (hash/time). They also add filters as VCs.

4. Matching Engine (off-chain) identifies mutual interest clusters (via encrypted bloom filters or private set intersection) and spins compute jobs.

5. Compute Jobs run in MPC/TEE clusters to compute MR, SpecificShares, and tentative allocations. The job emits zk-proofs and signed allocation proposals to participants.

6. Settlement: When both sides sign allocation receipts, the allocations are executed: i.e., provider unlocks capacity (makes booking, grants access, or emits a capability token that represents a one-time right). For physical capacities, this could be a signed voucher. For time/skill, it is a schedule entry in the provider's calendar system.

7. Dispute & Arbitration: If disputes arise, encrypted logs and MPC inputs can be revealed to an arbitrator per default governance rules; arbitration proofs anchored on-chain.

Tokenless Smart Contracts & Capabilities

Principles

Recognition values must not be fungible tokens. Instead, use capability tokens or signed one-time vouchers to represent an execution right that is non-transferable and bound to DIDs.

Capability Token Design

Capability = sign( provider_DID, recipient_DID, capacity_id, slot_id, nonce, expiry )

Stored as a signed JSON object; verifiable by any verifier via provider public key.

Not transferable: verifier checks recipient_DID.

On-chain Anchors

Only store small commitments: hash(commitment_blob) and meta (capacity id, timestamp, zk-proof reference, dispute timeout).

Optionally store capability revocation lists (CRLs) if a provider cancels.

---

APIs (REST + WebSocket)

Identity & Onboarding

POST /v1/participants - register DID + public key + VC credentials (KYC optional)

GET /v1/participants/{did} - public metadata

GET /v1/capacities?filter= - discover public metadata

Recognition & Desire Commitments

POST /v1/commitments/recognition - upload commitment hash

POST /v1/commitments/desire - upload desire commitment

GET /v1/commitments/{id} - retrieve commitment meta

GET /v1/disputes/{id} - status

---

Governance & Upgradability

On-chain Governance Registry stores protocol parameters (e.g., MPC/Tee operators, dispute arbitrators, oracle configs).

Governance model can be hybrid: democratic within an association (one-member-one-vote), delegated reputation, or council of stewards (for sovereign-level implementations).

Upgrades to computation logic require multi-signature of governance council plus zk-proof of backward-compatibility migrations.

---

Dispute Resolution

1. Automated Reconciliation: First attempt: verify receipts, signatures, and zk-proofs.

2. Mediation: If mismatch, auto-initiate a mediation window where both parties can submit clarifying evidence.

3. Arbitration: If unresolved, an arbitrator (pre-registered DID or institutional arbitrator) can request MPC inputs reveal under threshold encryption and issue binding ruling.

4. Punitive Measures: Repeated dishonest declarations may result in loss of reputation, temporary suspension, or removal from certain capacity classes. Reputation records are anchored but privacy-preserving (hashed reputation buckets unless consented to reveal).

---

Scaling & Performance

Sharding by Social Graph: Partition matching and compute by social subnetworks to localize computation.

Hierarchical Aggregation: Aggregate MR values at organizational nodes to reduce pairwise computations (sums & mins are associative under some transforms).

Asynchronous MPC Pools: Use rotating MPC operator pools, with job batching.

Cache & Incremental Compute: Store previous MR-normalization denominators and incremental deltas for small recognition updates.

---

Oracles & Data-Stream Integration

Capacities referencing external data (e.g., a sensor stream) declare an oracle_source with an oracle attestation method (TLSNotary, Chainlink-like signer, or direct signed telemetry). Oracle attestations are required to settle allocations tied to data outcomes.

Use authenticated data feeds, with signed checkpoints anchored on-chain for audits.

---

Legal & Compliance Considerations

KYC/AML: Where capacities have legal exposure (money-like exchanges, cross-border regulated services), require VC attestations for KYC.

Securities/Derivatives Law: Recognition derivatives that resemble financial options may trigger securities or derivatives laws. Design RDX to avoid fungible monetary payouts by default; if monetary settlement is desired, route via registered entity (swap dealer / licensed intermediary).

Data Protection: Comply with GDPR/CCPA: keep personal data encrypted and revealable only with consent or legal process.

Example Flows

Flow A — Individual Writing a "lesson" Option

1. Alice (provider) declares Capacity: 10 piano-hours/week, slotized. Commits declaration and posts hash.

2. Bob expresses Desire: 2 piano-hours/week; posts commitment.

3. System computes MR(Alice,Bob). If mutual-desire positive and allocation algorithm returns 2 hours, MPC produces allocation & zk-proof.

4. Alice signs capability for Bob for specific slots: cap = sign(Alice, Bob, cap_id, slot_ids, expiry).

5. Bob redeems capability; system records fulfilled allocation.

Flow B — Organization Offering Compute Capacity as Options

1. Org X publishes 1000 CPU-hours as capacities with filters requiring Org-level credentials.

2. Multiple recipients (startups) express desires; MR-based normalizations compute proportional allocations.

3. Organization issues non-transferable access-vouchers to recipients.

Flow C — Country-Level Mutual-Recognition Clearing

1. Country A and B exchange signed policy recognitions by Ministries (anchored commitments).

2. MR determines quotas for data-access or technical assistance. Capacities are national project slots (e.g., satellite time)

3. Settlement occurs via executed capacity allocations (scheduling, remote access credentials), not currency transfers.

---

UX Notes

Default views should emphasize privacy and simple consent flows.

Allow participants to preview effective allocations before confirm (showing aggregated MR normalization but not raw peer recognitions).

Provide explainable AI/graphs showing how recognition shifts influence allocations.

---

Roadmap & Implementation Phases

1. Phase 0 — Proof-of-Concept (PoC): Single org + small cohort, fully off-chain MPC, signed capabilities, no on-chain anchoring.

2. Phase 1 — Privacy-Preserving MVP: Add on-chain commitments, basic dispute flow, public discovery layer.

3. Phase 2 — Interoperability: Oracle integration, DID ecosystems, calendar/resources connectors, enterprise pilots.

4. Phase 3 — Sovereign Pilots: Regulatory sandbox with a friendly jurisdiction; country-to-country pilot for specific capacities (e.g., disaster response).

---

Risks & Mitigations

Data manipulation: Require signed telemetry & multiple oracle attestations. Use slashing of reputation for provable lies.

Sybil attacks: Use reputation credentials, VC attestations, social-graph proofs, or limited-capacity onboarding.

Legal classification as securities: Keep default settlement non-monetary; use licensed intermediaries for monetary components.

Computation cost: Use batched MPC and incremental computations; limit global full-graph recomputation frequency.

Closing Notes

This specification intentionally focuses on non-monetary, mutual-fulfillment-first design. Financial rails can be added as adapters but only after careful legal and governance design.

If you'd like, I can now:

produce a sequence diagram for a specific flow (PoC: Individual Lesson Option),

draft MPC/zK proof templates or pseudo-circuits for MR normalization,

sketch an API server + MPC operator architecture in code (TypeScript/Node) for Phase 0.

Which should I do next?
