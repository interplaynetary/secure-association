# FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CAPACITY COORDINATION

## Adopted at [City], [Date]

### PREAMBLE

The Parties to this Convention,

**Recognizing** that international cooperation on sustainable development, climate action, technology transfer, and capacity building requires innovative mechanisms beyond traditional financial instruments,

**Acknowledging** that sovereign nations possess diverse capacities—including expertise, resources, infrastructure access, and knowledge—that could be coordinated for mutual benefit without incurring debt obligations,

**Concerned** that existing international cooperation mechanisms often create dependencies, impose conditionalities, or require monetary settlements that constrain national sovereignty and policy space,

**Noting** that advances in distributed ledger technology, secure multi-party computation, and zero-knowledge cryptography enable privacy-preserving coordination of capacity exchanges at scale,

**Affirming** the sovereign right of each nation to determine its own recognition of other nations' contributions and to manage its capacity offerings according to national priorities,

**Convinced** that mutual recognition-based allocation of capacities can complement existing international cooperation frameworks while preserving sovereignty and avoiding debt accumulation,

**Recalling** the principles of the United Nations Charter, particularly Articles 55 and 56 on international economic and social cooperation,

**Taking into account** the Paris Agreement's provisions on technology transfer and capacity building, and the need for implementable mechanisms to fulfill these commitments,
V
**Determined** to establish a cooperative framework that enables efficient, transparent, and equitable coordination of capacities among nations,

Have agreed as follows:

---

## ARTICLE 3: RECOGNITION SOVEREIGNTY

**3.1** Each Party has the absolute and exclusive right to determine its recognition of every other Party, expressed as a percentage allocation of its Total Recognition.

**3.2** Recognition determinations are sovereign national decisions and shall not be subject to challenge, review, or appeal by any other Party, the Conference of Parties, or any body established under this Convention.

**3.3** Parties may change their recognition values at any time, provided that:
- (a) Such changes do not affect Capabilities already issued and not yet expired;
- (b) Changes are submitted through proper commitment mechanisms to ensure cryptographic integrity;
- (c) Parties act in good faith and do not manipulate recognition values solely to disrupt the operation of the RDX system.

**3.4** Parties are encouraged to base their recognition determinations on objective criteria, which may include but are not limited to:
- (a) Past cooperation and successful capacity exchanges;
- (b) Shared values, priorities, or development objectives;
- (c) Contributions to regional or global public goods;
- (d) Technical expertise or capacity strengths;
- (e) Vulnerability to shared risks or challenges;
- (f) Any other factors the Party deems relevant to its national interests.

- (h) The method and location of settlement;
- (i) Dispute resolution procedures, if deviating from standard procedures under Article 11.

**4.3** Capacity declarations shall be submitted to the RDX infrastructure with appropriate cryptographic signatures to ensure authenticity and non-repudiation.

**4.4** Parties may modify or withdraw capacity declarations at any time prior to the computation of allocations, but not after Capabilities have been issued based on those declarations.

**4.5** Parties expressing desire to receive another Party's offered capacity shall submit desire commitments through the RDX infrastructure, specifying:
- (a) The capacity identifier;
- (b) The quantity desired;
- (c) Any preferences regarding timing or delivery method;
- (d) Cryptographic proof of the desire commitment.

**4.6** Both capacity declarations and desire commitments shall be timestamped and anchored to distributed ledger infrastructure to ensure auditability and prevent disputes regarding timing.

---

## ARTICLE 5: ALLOCATION COMPUTATION

**5.1** Upon the close of each allocation period (as determined by the COP), the RDX system shall compute capacity allocations using the following methodology:

**5.1.1 Mutual Recognition Computation:**
For each pair of Parties (A, B), the Mutual Recognition value is calculated as:
MR(A,B) = min(R[A,B], R[B,A])

where R[A,B] represents Party A's recognition of Party B.

**5.1.2 General Share Computation:**
For a capacity offered by Provider Party P and recipient Party U, the General Share is:
GeneralShare(U, P) = MR(P, U) / Σ MR(P, x)

where the sum is taken over all Parties x with positive mutual desire for P's capacity.

**5.1.3 Specific Share Computation:**
If the capacity has eligibility filters, the Specific Share is:
SpecificShare(U, P, Capacity) = GeneralShare(U, P) × Filter(U, Capacity)

where Filter(U, Capacity) equals 1 if Party U meets the criteria, and 0 otherwise.

**5.1.4 Normalization:**
Specific Shares are normalized across all eligible recipients to sum to 1.

**5.1.5 Mutual Desire Application:**
Raw allocations are computed as:
RawAllocation(U) = Capacity.Quantity × NormalizedSpecificShare(U)

Final allocations are constrained by mutual desire:
FinalAllocation(U) = min(RawAllocation(U), DesireCommitment(U))

**5.1.6 Zero-Waste Redistribution:**
If total FinalAllocations < Capacity.Quantity, the remaining capacity is redistributed iteratively among unsatisfied Parties (those where FinalAllocation < DesireCommitment) proportional to their normalized Mutual Recognition values, until no further allocation is possible or all capacity is allocated.

**5.2** All allocation computations shall be performed using secure multi-party computation (MPC) or trusted execution environment (TEE) infrastructure to ensure that:
- (a) Individual recognition values remain private;
- (b) Computations are verifiable through zero-knowledge proofs;
- (c) No single Party or entity can manipulate the computation;
- (d) Results are deterministic and reproducible.

**5.3** Upon completion of allocation computation, the RDX system shall:
- (a) Generate zero-knowledge proofs of correct computation;
- (b) Notify affected Parties of their allocations;
- (c) Provide Parties an opportunity to confirm or dispute allocations within a specified timeframe;
- (d) Publish commitment hashes and allocation results (but not raw recognition values) to public distributed ledger infrastructure.

**5.4** Parties have the right to request detailed explanations of how their allocations were computed, which shall be provided through verifiable cryptographic proofs without revealing other Parties' private recognition values.

5. Built-in capacity building for equitable participation

**Expected Benefits:**
- Fulfillment of Paris Agreement technology transfer commitments
- Reduction in development financing gaps
- Strengthened South-South cooperation
- Preservation of policy space for developing countries
- Trust-building through demonstrated mutual benefit
- Resilience against financial system disruptions

**Safeguards:**
- Sovereignty over recognition values absolutely protected
- Dispute resolution available but not punitive
- Withdrawal rights preserved
- Privacy-preserving by design
- Open-source and auditable technology

**Next Steps for Interested States:**
1. Designate a focal point to engage with interim secretariat
2. Participate in technical working groups
